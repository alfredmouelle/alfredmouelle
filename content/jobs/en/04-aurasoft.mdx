# "AuraTax" SASS Development

## Context

**AuraTax** is a software solution developed by **AuraSoft Inc.** aimed at facilitating automated tax management and tax return filing. The platform allows users to manage their taxes online efficiently, while integrating advanced features for tax analysis and compliance.

Since **February 21, 2022**, I have been actively contributing as a **FullStack Developer** to the evolution of this platform, working on both the frontend and backend to meet the functional and technical needs of the product.

## My Role

My work at AuraSoft Inc. includes the following responsibilities:

- **Backend Development** with **Java Spring Boot** to implement robust and scalable APIs for managing users, tax returns, and complex calculations.
- **Frontend Development** with **Angular** and **TypeScript** to ensure a responsive, intuitive, and optimized user interface for AuraTax platform users.
- **Database Management** with **MongoDB**, used to store and manipulate large amounts of tax data quickly and securely.
- **E2E Testing** with **Cypress** (previously **Protractor**), ensuring comprehensive test coverage of the platform's critical features.
- **Code Versioning** via **Git**, **GitHub**, and **Gitea**, enabling effective collaborative work and smooth project version management.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Performance Management**: Given the large volume of tax data processed, optimizations were implemented at the MongoDB query level and backend architecture to ensure fast response times.
- **Data Security**: Security being paramount for a tax application, we implemented robust mechanisms for authentication, input validation, and data encryption to protect sensitive information.
- **Continuous Frontend Evolution**: User experience is crucial for AuraTax. We used **Angular** to create a modern and dynamic interface, taking user feedback into account to constantly improve the platform's usability and accessibility.

## Results

- **Increased Efficiency**: Thanks to optimized backend APIs and an improved user interface, AuraTax offers a smoother experience, allowing users to process their tax returns more quickly.
- **Continuous Improvement**: E2E tests with Cypress ensure that new features and improvements deployed are stable and regression-free.

## Technologies Used

- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Code Versioning**: Git, GitHub, Gitea
- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: Angular, TypeScript
- **E2E Testing**: Cypress (previously Protractor)

## Learning

This project has allowed me to gain in-depth expertise in **Java Spring Boot**, **Angular**, and **MongoDB**, as well as solid experience in automated testing with **Cypress**. It has also enabled me to strengthen my skills in version management and collaboration with multidisciplinary teams.
