# Development of a Management Platform for PINTO Company

## Context

PINTO Company is an IT Services Company (SSII). For the past 3 years, we have always been able to meet the technological challenges we have faced. Our team is reliable, courteous, and at the cutting edge of new technologies. Faced with a growing need to digitize internal processes and optimize operations tracking, the general manager, Mr. MBADI II Pierre Marie, wanted to implement a unified management platform to bring together the main areas of the company. This platform aimed to centralize device management, improve workflows, and facilitate recurring tasks.

PINTO Company is committed to providing high-quality service that meets international standards and norms, with constant innovation, continuous improvement, all within the planned deadlines. Each project is a new challenge and must be taken with great seriousness and particular attention.

## My Role

As a Web Developer at PINTO Company, my work consisted of participating in the development of both the **backend** and **frontend** of the management platform. More specifically, I was in charge of **device tracking**, an essential section for managing the equipment entering and leaving the company.

I also worked on implementing other features related to **device sales** and additional modules. My role extended to the complete modeling of the database as well as the integration of **third-party APIs**.

## Challenges Faced

- **Migration of manual processes to a digital system**: One of the major challenges was translating existing business processes into optimized digital workflows.
- **Data management**: Managing sensitive and complex data related to devices and clients required a reliable and high-performance architecture.
- **Dynamic front-end**: The integration of Ajax and JavaScript aimed to make the user interface more responsive while ensuring fast response times.

## Solutions Provided

I implemented the following features:

- **Device registration and tracking**: I developed a module to manage the entire lifecycle of devices, from registration to their exit, including steps like diagnosis, repair, and quote generation.
- **Backend development**: I used **PHP 7** to create robust and secure APIs, managing all business functionalities, including device administration and stock management.
- **Dynamic front-end**: I integrated **JavaScript** and **Ajax** to improve the user experience by making the application more fluid. I also used **jQuery** and **Bootstrap** for responsive design and dynamic interaction management.
- **Database**: I fully modeled the database in **UML 2.0** and integrated it via the **MySQL DBMS**. This included creating schemas, table relationships, and stored procedures to optimize complex queries.
- **Integration of third-party APIs**: I integrated several third-party APIs to enhance the platform's capabilities and enable interoperability with other external systems.

### Technologies Used

- **Back-end**: PHP, MySQL, Ajax
- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, AngularJS

## Results

Thanks to the platform, PINTO Company was able to:

- **Optimize processes**: Device tracking became much faster and more accurate, reducing manual errors and improving traceability.
- **Efficiency gains**: Tasks that were once manual and time-consuming are now automated, allowing staff to focus on other strategic aspects of the company.
- **Improved user experience**: The platform's responsiveness, thanks to the integration of Ajax and JavaScript, improved the user experience, especially in real-time device and sales management.

## Learning

This project allowed me to strengthen my skills in **backend development** with **PHP** and **MySQL**, as well as work with front-end technologies like **Bootstrap** and **AngularJS**. I also developed a solid understanding of third-party API integration and complex database modeling.
