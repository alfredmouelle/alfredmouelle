# Integration & QA Testing of Koree Apps & API

## Context

**Koree** is an innovative cashback application developed for Francophone Africa, offering a simple, secure, 100% digital, and convenient solution to enjoy the best deals while shopping. The idea of Koree was born in 2018 to solve the problem of change in stores and digitize small change.

Since **February 10, 2023**, I have contributed as a **Freelance QA Tester** to improving the quality and maintainability of the Koree API by performing E2E, unit, and integration tests. I have also participated in the development of the mobile application in **Flutter** and the API in **Laravel**.

## My Role

My work at Koree includes the following responsibilities:

- **E2E Testing** with **Cypress** to ensure comprehensive test coverage of critical features of the Koree & Koree Pro applications.
- **Backend Testing** with **Postman** to verify the integrity and performance of the Koree API.
- **Unit and Integration Testing** to ensure code quality and maintainability.
- **Mobile Development** with **Flutter**, integrating new features and fixing encountered issues.
- **Backend Development** with **Laravel** to enhance API features and ensure its quality and maintainability.
- **Code Versioning** via **Git** and **GitHub**, enabling effective collaborative work and smooth project version management.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Quality Assurance**: Implementing automated tests to detect regressions and ensure the stability of new features.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Collaborating with developers to enhance API features and optimize the code.
- **Mobile Development**: Integrating new features and resolving issues encountered in the Flutter mobile application.
- **Backend Optimization**: Improving the performance and maintainability of the Laravel API.

## Technologies Used

- **Testing**: Cypress, Postman
- **Code Versioning**: Git, GitHub
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Laravel
- **Mobile**: Flutter

## Results

- **Increased Quality**: Thanks to E2E and backend tests, the Koree application offers a more reliable and bug-free user experience.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Unit and integration tests ensure that new features and improvements deployed are stable and maintainable.
- **Improved Mobile Application**: New features integrated and issues resolved have enhanced the user experience of the mobile application.
- **Optimized API**: Improvements to the Laravel API have resulted in better performance and increased maintainability.

## Learning

This project has allowed me to gain in-depth expertise in **Cypress**, **Postman**, **Node.js**, **Flutter**, and **Laravel**, as well as solid experience in automated testing and version management with **Git** and **GitHub**. It has also strengthened my skills in collaboration with multidisciplinary teams.
